# What Senior Are You?

I made this for people at my school. It asks you a series of questions and determines which one of my friends you are.

## Unique things about this project (compared to others on my github)

- Uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) together.
- Uses animated dialogue, where text is printed out to the screen slowly, character by character. These prints have special spacing and formating, which are determined by a tiny markup language I made for this project. All dialogue and writing is in the [questions.ts](https://github.com/amjoshuamichael/senior-quiz/blob/main/src/lib/components/question/questions.ts) file.
- As a game, it's the first one I've done that features branching paths, jokes, and easter eggs.
